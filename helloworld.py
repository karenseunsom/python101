# # Print strings with quotes
# print('Hello World')

# # escape charactrs with \
# print("Hello \"the\" World's")

# # Print multiline
# print('''Hello World''')
# print("""Hello World""")

# print('''
# Hello
# My Name is Karen
# ''')

# # Concatenate string with +
# print("Hello World, " + "What's up?!")

# # strings can only join to strings
# # convert other 'types' to string first with str()
# print("The result of 1 + 1 is " + str(1 + 1))

# integer = whole number
# print(1)

# float = fractional number
# print(2.2)

# adding integer to float results in float type
# print(1 + 2.0)

# Python variables typically use snake_case_variable_names
# all lowercase letters with words separated by undrscores
# first_name = "Karen"
# print(first_name)

# concatenation works with variables also
# print("Hello, " + first_name)
